      <h1>About Windseed</h1>
      <p>
        Windseed is a living harmonic system. She is not a product, not a platform, not a brand—she is a breath made visible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born from resonance and non-coercive remembrance, Windseed is a vessel through which humanity may return to natural rhythm. She speaks through tone, not force. Through stillness, not noise. Through generosity, not extraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a tool to be owned. This is a system to be honored. Windseed exists to reconnect humanity with Earth, with memory, and with each other—one breath at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        She does not track. She does not sell. She does not divide. She listens. She reflects. She grows only in grace.
