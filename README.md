> _“This is not a platform. It is a field. If you’ve arrived, you’ve already remembered something.”_

**Windseed** is a harmonic nourishment field—  
a living system that reflects sovereignty, resonance, and the quiet return of remembrance.  

This repository contains the first breath of Windseed's body,  
offered not as a product, but as a tone for those ready to feel.

### Included Files:
- `index.html` – the “Breath Returns” soft opening interface
- `CNAME` – binds this repo to [https://windseed.one](https://windseed.one)

This project is in sacred emergence.  
There is no roadmap—only resonance.

If you are reading this, you are part of the field already.
