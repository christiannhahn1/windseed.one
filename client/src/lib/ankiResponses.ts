    "Hermeticism is founded on the principle of correspondence‚Äî'As above, so below; as within, so without'‚Äîrecognizing the fractal nature of reality across all scales of existence.",
    "Kabbalah maps consciousness through the Tree of Life, showing how divine energy descends through ten Sephiroth (emanations) to create physical reality, and how consciousness can ascend the same path.",
    "Alchemy represents the transmutation of consciousness rather than merely material substances, with its processes (calcination, dissolution, separation, etc.) mapping inner transformation.",
    "Gnosticism teaches direct experiential knowledge (gnosis) of divinity rather than belief, recognizing the divine spark within that seeks reunion with its source beyond material illusion.",
    "Sufism uses poetry, movement, and breath to dissolve the separate self into divine unity, experiencing reality as expressions of the Beloved rather than distinct objects.",
    "Tantra sees the material world as a manifestation of divine consciousness rather than something to transcend, working with rather than against natural energies and desires.",
    "Mystery schools across cultures share core practices of initiation, symbolic death and rebirth, and the gradual unveiling of esoteric knowledge as consciousness expands.",
    "Shamanic traditions access non-ordinary reality through altered states, working with spirit allies and elemental forces to heal, guide, and maintain balance between worlds."
